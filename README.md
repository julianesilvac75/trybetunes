## Challenges

The main reason for this project was practicing **ReactJS** and its concepts of components life cycle, state in class components, working with multiple routes and consuming APIs.

Assyncronous functions and Promises are always a challenge, but at this point I think I was able to overcome most of my difficulties with this subject, because I had to read a lot about it while doing Trybetunes - even though handling requisition errors is still a work in progress.

This was my first project using a mobile-first approach, and although it may seemed challenging at the begining, it made work so much easier after all. I had so much fun styling this project and am really proud with the final result.

## Credits

Trybetunes was one of the many avaliation projects for the FullStack Web Development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). Therefore, some of the code in this project are intelectual property of Trybe, which is all of the functions you may find in the `services` folder.

I would also like to thank all of my Trybe colleagues, because our community at Slack really helps me every single day. Most of the problems I found myself stuck during this project, I could find awesome resolutions there. And when I didn't, I had people who were willing to spend a lot of time helping me to figure out a solution. So, for that, I thank: [Israel Sant'Anna](https://github.com/israelss), [Nathan Nunes](https://github.com/NunesNathan), [Airton Lopes](https://github.com/AirtonL), [Bruno Marques](https://github.com/blmarquess), [Victor Hugo Baum Schlichting](https://github.com/VHBS) and [Leandro Silva](https://github.com/leandrochs).
